This repository is created for assignment 2 of the IAC Module

# Project Detailed Summary

The goal of this project is to create a bugfix branch named "bugfix" for the Powershell exercises carried out for the weeks 9 to 12. This project has completed by following best practices from the Powershell and Git Hub walkthroughs as specified by the lecturer. The "bugfix" branch is created for this project for the purpose of fixing the bugs already exists to the project, and merge the "bugfix" branch to the "main" branch. Additionally "Dev", "new-features" and "Test" branches were also created by following the best practices in industries as well as the lecturer's notes.   

## **Project Scope**

The project aims to create a new repository "Powershell" on the student's Git hub account and follow the best practices mentioned by lecturer to merge the bugfix branch named "bugfix" with "main" branch.  

The project scope involves the following.
1. To copy all the powershell scripts from weeks 9 to 12 as specified by the lecturer's notes using the GIT CLI (Command line interface) as well as GIT Hub GUI (Graphical User Interface) to a folder named "Powershell" in the Git Hub.
3. To briefly outline the functionality of the scripts copied.
4. Create a bugfix branch "bugfix" along with other recommended branches (main, dev, new-features and test).
5. Merge the "bugfix" branch to the "main" branch after modifying a script.
6. Include appropriate documentation and comments in the programs as well as readme.md file.

## **Project Status**

There are no outstanding tasks or module restrictions because the project has successfully met all of the outlined goals, which are listed below.

1. A folder structure with exercises created to the GIT Hub using the GIT CLI.
2. All the practiced programs for Python for the weeks 2 to 5 were copied to the folder structure. 
3. The functionality of the codes are briefly explained. 
4. A "bugfix" branch was created along with main, new-features, dev and test branches.
5. The "bugfix" branch was merged with "main" branch. 
6. The project contains the appropriate documentation and comments in the readme.md file. 

## **Getting Started**

### **Script Quality**
All powershell scripts were updated with proper comments.

### **Detailed description of the Powershell Scripts**

#### <u>**Powershell folder:-**</u>
This folder contains scripts practiced for installation of powershell version 7 to the student laptop and the prerequisites required for the installation. It also contains the scripts for finding all the modules in powershell and customisation of a new module. The folder also contains scripts for commissioning a new domain controller for a new forest “ads.solarsubmaines.com” along with commissioning of a new member server to the same active directory forest. The scripts also focus on configuring the Desired State Configuration (DSC) and Managed Object Format (MOF) and their practical applications. 

### **Code Maintenance in Git Hub and History of Execution Summary**

All the codes are saved to Git Hub location https://github.com/sibilawrenceatu/PowerShell.git. 
The project has 5 branches named "main" (where all the final codes are merged and saved from other branches), a "test" branch (this branch is used to test the codes before committing to the main branch), a "dev" branch (used by developers of the project for new developments related to existing project), a "Newfeatures" branch (where new features are developed and merge to the main branch), and a "bugfix" branch which is used to fixing the bugs in the exisitng project and finally merge to the main branch.

The "bugfix" branch was updated with necessary modifications to the comments in the powershell scripts and finally merged to the main branch. The versioning of all committed files are available and can be accessed from Git-Hub on demand by either using the command line interface or the Visual Studio Code software by cloning the repository URL https://github.com/sibilawrenceatu/PowerShell.git.
